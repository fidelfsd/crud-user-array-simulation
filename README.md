# CRUD User Array Simulation

This repository offers a basic implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a `User` model using JavaScript classes. Data storage is simulated with arrays, allowing for easy in-memory management of user data without the need for a database.

## How to Use

1. **Modify `main.js`**: You can add or remove CRUD operation examples in the `main.js` file to suit your needs.

2. **Run the Project**: To start the project, execute the following command:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
